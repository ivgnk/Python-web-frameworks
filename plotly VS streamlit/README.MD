*[Dash is a Python framework built on top of React, a JavaScript library...  "describing Dash as a Python framework misses a key feature of its design: the Python side (the back end/server) of Dash was built to be lightweight and stateless [allowing] multiple back-end languages to coexist on an equal footing". It is possible to integrate D3.js charts as Dash components.[32] Dash provides the default CSS (and HTML and JavaScript, and you can add your own), but for custom styling Dash applications CSS can be added, or Dash Enterprise used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotly#Dash)*             

*Streamlit is an open-source Python library that provides development components to create and share beautiful and easy to use custom web applications for machine learning and data science*
