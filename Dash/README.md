## [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotly#Dash)               
Dash is a Python framework built on top of React, a JavaScript library. 
It is possible to integrate D3.js charts as Dash components. 
Dash provides the default CSS (and HTML and JavaScript, and you can add your own), but for custom styling Dash applications CSS can be added, or Dash Enterprise used.
Dash Enterprise is Plotly’s paid product for building, testing, deploying, managing and scaling Dash applications organization-wide.
 With open-source Dash, analytic applications can be run from a local machine, but cannot be easily accessed by others in the organization
